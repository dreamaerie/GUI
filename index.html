    <h2>Enjoy the Emptiness of my Mind</h2>
    <p>
      Enter my mind and explore the unknowable universe that is my brain. There
      in lies the ideas that makes the creature Derek. Or at least, the bare
      minimum. I aspire to hold as little thoughts in my head as possible, as my
      feeble brain can never truly keep up with the grandiose ideas are birthed
      inside that ecosystem. If only my hands were as developed as my thoughts,
      then I could truly create a website that could completely encapsulate my
      personality. But as it stands, we will have to settle with this slightly
      silly rendition of my mind all done in the Windows Paint program.
