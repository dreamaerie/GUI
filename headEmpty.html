          So you think this is a joke? That this little goober ISN'T me? Well
          honestly I don't know what I was thinking when I drew this thing. I
          remember wanting a new profile picture for some SNS app, and the next
          thing I knew, this abomination was looking at me. Despite its
          horrifying nature, I am actually a big fan of it. It really does
          capture the struggle of life, the perputual act of pushing a large
          boulder up a hill day in and day out, only to have it roll back down
          right when you reach the top. And despite melting into a soupy puddle
          from the harsh rays of reality, this Goober has the power to give the
          world a thumbs up. Powerful stuff.

          Shrimp. I'm a big fan of shrimp. Shrimp is real good. So good in fact
          that I think the S in super stands for shrimp. Generally does not
          matter how its prepared most shrimp dishes are excellent. But if I had
          to pick one shrimp dish to survive off of for the rest of my days, it
          would be coconut shrimp. Just such a delightful dish. A perfect
          balance of savoury and sweet, and can be complimented by any sauce of
          ones choosing. Simply a perfect dish in my eyes. I only pity those
          with shellfish allergies.

          I jive with good music. Typically I listen to J-rock and R&B, but I
          listen to a lot of different genres; It really just depends on my
          mood. Some days its a heavy metal day, other days its a classical
          music angle. My favorite musical artist would have to be Eve or Raito.
          Eve is a japanese singer/songwriter that makes a variety of different
          kinds of music, with a lot of bangers that I like. Raito on the other
          hand specializes in music for video games, which means that his music
          is usually high energy and very catchy. I like to listen to his music
          while working on projects and the sort, and depending on what songs I
          listen to the theme of my projects end up feeling like whatever I
          listened to at the time.
